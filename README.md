# sercelCustomTool

Code I writed from scratch during my internship at Sercel (Nantes)
Compile it with cx_freeze : python build.py

tkinter Interface, selenium web scrapper


Drastically reduce control time, automatic export.


Works with the company's intranet, since there is no API it relies on selenium web scraping with advanced CSS selectors and XPATH.


MVP cli then GUI with tkinter


Developped from scratch.
